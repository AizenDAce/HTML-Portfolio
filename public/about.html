<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Ahmed Abdelrahman, a passionate web developer with a strong drive to continuously learn, grow, and evolve in the ever-changing tech landscape.</p>

<p>I specialize in front-end and back-end development, with experience in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, and PostgreSQL. I'm also skilled in using GitHub for version control, and I have a solid understanding of Flexbox, Web 3, and databases, which enables me to build responsive, dynamic, and user-friendly websites and applications.</p>

<p>One of my core values is improvement and personal development. I'm always looking for new opportunities to refine my skills and tackle exciting challenges in the tech world. Whether it's learning a new programming language, optimizing code for performance, or staying up-to-date with the latest trends, I am committed to leveling up my expertise and delivering high-quality results.</p>

<p>Outside of programming, I'm an avid lover of drawing and animations. I find that creativity and technical skills often go hand in hand, and my artistic side helps me bring a unique, visually appealing perspective to my development projects.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a motivated developer with a passion for technology and personal growth, I'd love to connect and collaborate on exciting projects!</p>
